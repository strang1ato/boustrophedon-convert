To convert `html` file to boustrophedon writting style, download `boustrophedon.css` and `boustrophedon.js`, then add to the beginning and to the end of `html` file these two lines, respectively:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="boustrophedon.css">`
`<script src="boustrophedon.js"></script>`
(Note: you can treat `txt` file as `html` file simply by changing file extension to `.html`)

If you want to convert your boustrophedon `html` file to PDF, just open your file in browser (I use firefox) and press "Print..." button to convert your `html` file to PDF, which is suitable for e-book readers.
